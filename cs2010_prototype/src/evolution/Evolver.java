 * Class to model a Evolutionary cycle where an array of 'perfect values' and two parent biomorphs are given, and one child (with gene values being that of
 * whichever parent had the value closest to the value set out in the 'perfect values' array) is returned. Depending on the numbers in the 'perfect values'
 * array, models evolution quite closely as a child biomorph has for each gene either the mothers gene value or the fathers, not a blend of the values for
 * each gene.
